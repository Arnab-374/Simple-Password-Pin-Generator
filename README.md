# Simple-Password-Pin-Generator
This is a simple password/pin generator created using python. This is a very simple demonstration of how a password/pin generator can be made. For now, the code only generates pins (4/6 digits) and passwords (8/16 characters).

The code only utlizes the basics of python such as string concatenation, random function, join method, creating and calling functions, defining variables, changing a string into a list and changing it back, etc. 

The code can be improved upon significantly in order to incorporate characteristics such as the password not starting with a special character or number, etc. 

The idea behind this password generator was simply to incorporate some of the basic features of python to create a viable project of sorts.
